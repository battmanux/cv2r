cv2r is an R wrapper to Pyhon OpenCV using reticulate.
There is a few additions to simplify the integration in RStudio.

```{r}
library(cv2r)

img_url <- "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/fr/4/4e/RStudio_Logo.png"

my_image <- imread(img_url)

# Very simple to plot images
imshow(mat=my_image)
```

There is also a few modifications to simplify image pixel selection. You can use R matrix index on an numpy.ndarray variable.

```{r}

# Lets show the alpha mask
imshow(mat=my_image[,,4])
```

```{r}
# To use advances matrix subseting you shall convert the matrix to R 
my_r_image <- reticulate::py_to_r(my_image)
imshow(mat=my_r_image[50:300,200:900,c(4,2,2)])
```
